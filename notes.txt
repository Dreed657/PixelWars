    Web Socket server:

        On new client connect check if canvasId is valid 
        Sent plays to rest
        Sent snapshots to rest
    
    Rest:
        - CRUD canvas
        - Save snapshots of the canvas
        - Save any play

        canvas:
            /getById/{id}
            /getAll (paged?)
            /create
            /update/{id}
            /delete/{id}

            Schema:
            {canvasId, size, createdAt}
        
        snapshots:
            /getById/{id}
            /getAll (paged?)
            /create
            /update/{id}
            /delete/{id}

            Schema:
            {snapshotId, canvasId, createdAt, canvas: []}

        plays:
            /save 

            Schema:
            {canvasId, clientId, cellData: { x, y, color }, createdAt}
